# Python-Api-Challenge

In part one, called WeatherPy, a Python script was used to visualize weather data for more than 500 cities located at varying distances from the equator. A  citipy library was used to identify the nearest cities based on latitude and longitude, as well as the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information. Through this project, I utilized my problem-solving abilities to create a comprehensive representation of weather patterns across these cities.

In part two called VacationPy, my objectives were to revolve around utilizing the Geoapify API and harnessing the capabilities of the geoViews Python library. These visualizations will serve as tools for planning and selecting potential vacation destinations based on the weather data collected.
